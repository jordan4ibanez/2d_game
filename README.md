 A 2d game written in D with Raylib

This is an object oriented exercise, so it'll look very strange!

How to use map editor:
1. Defaults to atlas browser mode, click the tile you want.
2. Press tab to go into map editor mode
3. Left click is place, right click is delete
4. Hold left shift, and then drag while holding the left mouse button to move around
5. Todo: Export to JSON or something on save button :P


### Here is a preview of the map editor:
